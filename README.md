# SLToken - The overall aim of SLT is to create a fast, simple, safe and clearly defined platform that everyone can understand without hidden intentions and costs. 
The platform also aims to emulate the very operational logic of the blockchain in its operations by catering to a decentralized market. 
Instead of appealing to only a fraction of the available global market, SLT will allow anyone to have access to the platform, and it ensure that equal chances are given to all members to earn. 
The final aim of SLT is to be able to deliver on the promise of instant payments and withdrawals using blockchain technology.
  
 Short Term Action Plan
 - Adding SLT on other exchanges 
- Digital asset Exchanger ( multi-cryptocurrency exchange) 
- Wallet exchanger 
- Debit Card and adding other cards that will allow buying and withdrawals
- Mobile app available for iOS and Android

 It is expected that users will even have the opportunity to make payments and withdraw money using the SLT Card, which will be integrated with major existing fiat providers to give maximum flexibility across crypto and fiat channels to SLT platform users. 

SLT token is listed on following exchangers: Coindeal, Mercatox, Crex24

Thank you for your support and happy earning to all!
